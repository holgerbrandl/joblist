Parameters missing!!

/projects/genome/bin/scripts/para action jobListName [jobListFile] [-q queue] [-p bsubParameters] [-v|verbose] [-maxNumResubmission int] [-noResubmitIfQueueMaxTimeExceeded] [-resubmitToSameQueueIfQueueMaxTimeExceeded] [-keepBackupFiles]
where action can be:    make, push, pushCrashed, check, wait, stop, chill, time, crashed, clean

   make          pushes the joblist, monitors progress, pushes failed jobs again a maximum of 3 times, waits until all jobs are done or jobs crashed >3 times
   push          pushes the joblist
   pushCrashed   determines which jobs crashed and pushes those jobs again unless they failed 3 times already. It uses the same bsub parameters. Queue is the same, unless a job failed with exceeding the runtime limit.
   check         checks how many jobs in the current joblist are done. Exit code 0 if all succeeded. Otherwise exit code 255.
   wait          'connects' to a running jobList and waits until the running and pending jobs are done, pushes failed jobs again a max of 3 times.
   stop          stops all running and pending jobs in the jobList --> You can recover all stopped and crashed jobs with 'crashed'
   chill         stops all pending jobs only. Lets the running jobs continue to run. --> You can recover all stopped and crashed jobs with 'crashed'
   time          outputs runtime statistics and an estimation when all jobs are finished
   crashed       outputs all crashed jobs into the given output filename
   clean         remove all internal para files and LSF output files for the given jobListName
The number of input parameters depends on the action:

General parameters
   -v|--verbose                                 enable verbose output
   -maxNumResubmission int                      set the max number of times a crashed job will be pushed again (default 3). NOTE: has only an effect when doing para make
   -noResubmitIfQueueMaxTimeExceeded            do not resubmit the jobs that failed because they exceeded the runtime limit of the queue (default is do resubmit)
   -resubmitToSameQueueIfQueueMaxTimeExceeded   resubmit the jobs that failed because they exceeded the runtime limit of the queue, but resubmit to the same (rather than the next longest) queue.
                                                Only useful, if your job checks which preliminary results exist (e.g. for input elements the output file already exist).
   -keepBackupFiles                             if set, keep a backup of every internal para file in a dir .para/backup/ (backup files will be produced everytime the internal files are updated)
