# JobList

A task list manager for hpc-clusters. Among others it supports monitoring, automatic resubmission, profiling, and reporting of job lists

# Outline

What -->  Why --> Usecases + Live Examples

---

# Concept

Conceptually JobList `jl` is just managing lists of job-ids as reported by the underlying queuing system
```
>cat .some_jobs 
860671
860681
860686
860688
860691
```

* Processing states: Did they finish? Exit codes?
* Runtime statistics: How long? How much pending When?
* Stderr/out Logs?
* Metrics?

---
# Why not snakemake, GATK/Q or DRMAA?

* Workflow-graph not always well defined or contains just a single node
* [Snakemake](https://bitbucket.org/johanneskoester/snakemake/wiki/Home): own programming language
* [Queue](https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/topic?name=queue): Too much tuned to GATK
* Not tools for direct flow control, but for workflow execution engines

* [DRMAA](http://www.drmaa.org/): Just (bloated) API not a tool; reference v2 has not been touched since 3y

Needed:
* Simplistic cross-cluster job-control toolchain, with reporting, convenient API access, and support for different HPC platforms

???

Other motivations
* increase robustness and quality of existing hpc-workflows
* deepen understanding of HPC in general
* get away from bash
* hone scala skills
* do some nice API design

# Please welcome  ... **JobList**


* Submit, monitor and wait until an entire a list of clusters jobs has finished
* Report average runtime statistics, and predict the remaining runtime of a joblist based on cluster load and job complexities
* Recover crashed jobs and resubmit them again using a customizable set of resubmission strategies.

# Basic Usage

```
> jl --help
Usage: jl <command> [options] [
    <joblist_file>]

        Supported commands are
        submit Submits a named job including automatic stream redirection and adds
        it to the list
        add Extract job-ids from stdin and add them to the list
        wait Wait for a list of tasks to finish
        status Prints various statistics and allows to create an html report for the
        list
        kill Removes all queued jobs of this list from the scheduler
        up Moves a list of jobs to the top of a queue if supported by the
        underlying scheduler

        If no
        <joblist_file> is provided, jl will use '.jobs' as default
            ```
            * Cover all essential manipulation tasks for a given joblist
            * Cross-platform, just requires Java (and optionally R+pandoc) for reporting
            * Written in Scala but assembled into self-contained jar-bundle

            ---
            # Example: Simple Monitoring

            * Use `jl` for blocking and monitoring and final status handling

            ```bash
            bsub "echo foo" | jl add
            bsub "sleep 10; echo bar" | jl add
            bsub "exit 1" | jl add

            jl wait

            if [ -n "$(jl status --failed)" ]; then
            echo "some jobs failed"
            fi

            jl status --report
            ```
            * Does not change existing workflows but complements them

            ---
            # Example: Submission

            ```bash
            jl submit "sleep 10" ## add a job
            jl submit "sleep 1000" ## add another which won't fit in our default queue

            ## wait and resubmit failing jobs to another queue
            jl wait --resubmit_queue long
            ```

            * Decouple workflows from underlying queuing system
            * Automatic resubmission using different patterns (diff queue, walltime, threads, ...)

            --


            ## Where is the scheduler?

            --

            Who cares?

            ---

            # Platform Support

            `jl` provides (some) abstraction from the underlying queuing system:

            --

            * LSF

            ``` bash
            jl submit "echo 'hello lsf'"
            ```

            --

            * SLURM

            ``` bash
            jl submit "echo 'hello slurm'"
            ```

            --

            * Any Local Computer

            ``` bash
            jl submit "echo 'hello computer'"
            ```
            * `jl` provides abstraction for common properties but also supports scheduler specific settings
            * Total abstraction not feasible and also not desired

            ???

            like custom memory options for

            ---
            # Bundled In-Place Scheduler

            * Takes into account threading settings
            * Interruptable
            * *Scheduler-Jumping*: change scheduler for existing joblist

            ```bash
            jl submit "sleep 10"
            jl submit "sleep 20"

            jl wait --report # ctrl-c

            ## fix something, and try again
            jl wait --report

            ```

            * Sidenote:
            [It](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/joblist/blob/master/src/main/scala/joblist/local/LocalScheduler.scala)'s
            implementation a lovely piece of art

            ---
            # API

            * `bash` sub-optimal for workflow development, thus use something decent

            ```scala
            import joblist._


            val jl = JobList()

            jl.run(JobConfiguration("echo foo"))
            jl.run(JobConfiguration("echo bar"))

            // block execution until are jobs are done
            jl.waitUntilDone()

            // optionally we could investigate jobs that were killed by the queuing system
            val killedInfo: List[RunInfo] = jl.killed.map(_.info)

            // resubmit to other queue
            jl.resubmit(new OtherQueue("long"))
            ```
            * Also supports Java (or any other JVM language)

            ---
            # Roadmap

            * Improve robustness and failure tolerance
            * Fix Travis CI integration to let [test
            suite](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/joblist/tree/master/src/test/scala/joblist) shine
            * Improve Java interoperability
            * Reporting Improvements (resubmission graph, cpu consumption)
            * For complete list see [issue tracker](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/joblist/issues)

            ???

            * Failure tolerance: Occasional 30s plus waiting time for squeue
            * More general support for slurm (and not just taurus)
